# ☁️ Mist.AI – V10  
**The Final Chapter**

Mist.AI is an advanced AI assistant built with **Gemini**, **Command R**, **Mistral**, **Gemini Vision**, and real-time web grounding.  
Version **10** marks the **final major web release** of Mist.AI—a milestone focused on UI polish, reliability, and legacy preservation.

## ⚠️ Why V10 is the Final Web Release

V10 felt like a natural milestone to stop at. Mist.AI has grown far beyond a simple school project—it can hold its own alongside ChatGPT and Claude. 🚀🧠  

Over time, I realized that pushing more updates risked breaking the core idea of Mist.AI, and I was running out of new directions without overcomplicating it. The natural evolution was to move toward the **Desktop version**, where more powerful features and native integrations are possible. 🖥️✨  

Mist.AI started as a late-night school project, but it quickly grew into something real people used. People wanted updates, so I poured myself into it—often spending days or even months building, testing, and refining features.  

This final update also comes with the reality of **burnout and costs**—I spent literally **$36** as a **high school** student to bring this to life. 💸 Despite that, I’m genuinely proud of what I’ve accomplished.  

From here til I give up on coding (never) I will be doing bug fixes but never more relases unless its for new models like a new AI model that will just boost MistAI

V10 is the **last web release**. It’s a milestone, a legacy, and a foundation for what comes next. Everything beyond this point moves toward Mist.AI Desktop.  
**To everyone who used Mist.AI—thank you. Genuinely.** ❤️

# 🏁 V10 — Final Web Release Notes

What started as a small experiment with Gemini turned into a real AI platform used by real people.  
V10 wasn’t originally planned to be the end—but it felt like the right milestone to close this chapter.

This project grew through janky commits, midnight hotfixes, README rewrites, and constant system rewrites that barely held together at first.  
Along the way, Mist.AI became an engineering playground—teaching backend systems, LLM pipelines, frontend architecture, and real-world reliability far beyond any classroom.

Mist.AI isn’t disappearing.  
V10 marks the end of the **web-era build** and the foundation for what comes next—especially the desktop platform.
