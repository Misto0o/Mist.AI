The clip quickly spread on TikTok, inspiring memes and edits of streamer Ninja with a low taper fade. By mid-January, TikTok users created slideshows, reaction videos, and joke claims that the song was by Frank Ocean. The meme exploded when Ninja himself acknowledged it and even got the haircut on January 13th, posting a TikTok that amassed over 5.4 million views in three days. Later in 2024, a parody meme about Tfue and a high taper fade went viral. By the end of the year, people joked about how the meme was still popular, with absurd edits of Ninja in different lifetimes.",
